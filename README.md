# Treasure Trove
*Create and Discover*

## What?
Treasure Trove is an interactive
point-and-click treasure hunt game that
takes interesting images of pictures, photos,
and objects from Trove and maps them to
cities in Australia. Players play against the
clock to find a list of hidden
treasures, and learn about the images along
the way as well!

## Who?
Treasure Trove can be used by teachers in
Custom mode where they can choose the
treasures to be found. Children aged 6 - 12
can play the games set by their teacher, or
simply just for fun using the computer generated
Discovery mode.

## How?
Trove APIs are used for teachers to find
items and auto-fill information during game
creation in Custom mode. Trove APIs (with
keyword search, year and location tags) are
also used to place treasures in Discovery
mode, and generate city backgrounds.
